In this lesson, we will build a BMI calculator and practice using the following widgets:

- **`TextField` widget**
- **`TextEditingController`**

1. Get the starter project from [GitHub](https://github.com/JoinCODED/flutter_bmi_calculator_starter), open it in VS Code, and get the packages.

2. In this starter project, the images that we will use inside the app were already added. A **Column** was used to display the widgets vertically on the screen. The first widget is an **Icon** that shows the monitor weight icon.
