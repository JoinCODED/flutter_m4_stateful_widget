In this example, we will build a BMI calculator.

We will learn how to use these new Widgets:

- **`TextField` widget**
- **`TextEditingController`**

1. Download the starter project from the GitHub, then open the project by using the VS Code, and get the packages.

2. In this starter project, we already added the images that we will use inside the app. Also, we used a **Column** widget to add widgets from top to bottom screen. The first widget we have is an **Icon** widget that shows the monitor weight icon.
